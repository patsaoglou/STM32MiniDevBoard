# STM32MiniDevBoardV1

This mini development board is based to a STM32F103C8T6 and has external pins to interface with all of the mcu io pins. The board is powered from the +5V USB rail or a 5V external pin and it is regulated down to 3.3V using an AMS1117-3.3 LDO regulator.

In this repository i share the Gerber, CPL, and BOM files which are configured for JLCPCB manufacturing. I do not have the boards on hand at the moment and i will update the repo in case i make the order.

If you have any questions or you would like to recommend any changes to the design feel free to contact me. I would highly appreciate it!
